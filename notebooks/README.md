## Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks for exploration, prototyping, and reporting.

- Prefix filenames with a date (`2025-11-11_data_audit.ipynb`) for easy sorting.
- Store large outputs (CSV, images) under `notebooks/artifacts/` or external storage; keep repos lean.
- Convert finalized notebooks into scripts or docs to avoid bitrot.

Remember to clear cell outputs before committing unless the rendered result is essential.
