## Market Configs

Store JSON/YAML files that describe individual markets:

- trading hours and session calendars
- venue tick sizes and fee schedules
- symbol metadata (lot sizes, margin requirements, etc.)

Name files after the market or exchange (`nasdaq.yaml`, `nse.json`, …) so they are easy to locate.
