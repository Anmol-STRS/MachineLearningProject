## Documentation

Use this space for user guides, architecture notes, and onboarding docs.

- `overview.md` for high-level context
- `api/` for REST or gRPC references
- `adr/` for Architecture Decision Records

All diagrams should have a source (Mermaid, draw.io, etc.) checked in alongside exported images.
